<!--
**ajzeigert/ajzeigert** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Andy is a software developer at [GeoEngineers](https://www.geoengineers.com), where I work on all kinds of projects for use by our scientists and engineers. In a former life, I worked as a graphics reporter and designer at a newspaper, and I still consider myself a data visualization enthusiast!

I love working on maps, charts and user interfaces. I mostly make stuff for the web using javascript.

I don't do much social media these days, but I do post occasional pictures [@zeigert](https://www.instagram.com/zeigert/) on Instagram.

You can also find me [@zeigert](https://glitch.com/@zeigert) on Glitch and [@ajzeigert](https://observablehq.com/@ajzeigert) on Observable.
