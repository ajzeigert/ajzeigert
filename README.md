**ajzeigert/ajzeigert** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am a software developer at [GeoEngineers](https://www.geoengineers.com), where I work on all kinds of projects for use by our scientists and engineers. In a former life, I worked as a graphics reporter and designer at a newspaper, and I still consider myself a data visualization enthusiast!

I love working on maps, charts and user interfaces. I mostly make stuff for the web using javascript.
