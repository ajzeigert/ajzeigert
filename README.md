**ajzeigert/ajzeigert** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am a software developer at [GeoEngineers](https://www.geoengineers.com), where I work on all kinds of projects for use by our scientists and engineers. In a former life, I worked as a graphics reporter and designer at a newspaper, and I still consider myself a data visualization enthusiast!

I love working on maps, charts and user interfaces. I mostly make stuff for the web using javascript.

My website is [https://zeigert.com](https://zeigert.com). You can find me on the fediverse [@zeigert@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@zeigert).

You can also find me [@zeigert](https://glitch.com/@zeigert) on Glitch and [@ajzeigert](https://observablehq.com/@ajzeigert) on Observable.
